# Problem 5.5
\
\ \ (a)Plot the weights versus the nodes.

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
x<-c(-0.973906528517172,-0.865063366688985,-0.679409568299024,-0.433395394129247,-0.148874338981631,0.148874338981631,0.433395394129247,0.679409568299024,0.865063366688985,0.973906528517172)

A<-c(0.066671344308688,0.149451394150581,0.219086362515982,0.269266719309996,0.295524224714753,0.295524224714753,0.269266719309996,0.219086362515982,0.149451394150581,0.066671344308688)

#Plot
plot(x,A,xlab="Nodes",ylab="Weights",type="o")
```
(b)
\
\ \ Integration:$\int_{-1}^{1}x^{2}dx=\dfrac{2}{3}$, therefore the area under the curve $y=x^{2}$ between $-1$ and $1$ is $\dfrac{2}{3}$.
\
\ \ Next, move on to calculate the estimated value of the integration with Gauss-Legendre quadrature(The Gaussian quadrature rule having $w(x)=1$ for integrals on $[-1,1]$)

```{r}
Estimate<-0
for (i in 1:10){
  Estimate<-Estimate+A[i]*(x[i])^2
}
Estimate
```


```{r}
#Show the precision

error<-(Estimate-2/3)
error
```
\
\ \ Comments:
\
\ \ The value estimated by Gauss-Legendre quadrature is very close to the true value. The error term is at $10^{-8}$ order of magnitude.
